			As members of the Grade batch 2026 "C.O.D.A.S", we have embarked on a project that aims to provide a valuable tool for the incoming freshies of our school. Our project is an interactive map that is designed to help the new students navigate their way around the school with ease and have a fun experience while doing so. <br><br>

			We understand that starting a new school can be overwhelming, especially for students who are not familiar with the layout of the campus. That's why we have developed this interactive map, which provides detailed information on the location of different facilities and buildings within the school. This includes classrooms, laboratories, libraries, sports facilities, and more.<br><br>

			Our interactive map is user-friendly and easy to navigate, and it is designed to be accessible to everyone. It features a simple interface that allows users to zoom in and out, pan across the map, and search for specific locations. In addition, the map also provides relevant information about each location, such as opening hours, contact details, and a brief description of the facilities available.<br><br>

			We believe that our interactive map will not only help the freshies find their way around the school but also enhance their overall experience in our school. With this map, they will be able to explore the different areas of the school and discover new facilities that they may not have known about otherwise.
